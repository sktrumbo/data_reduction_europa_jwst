Procedure to generate combined Europa spectral cubes

1. Download all "cal" and "rate" files from Program 1250, observation #2.
2. In IDL, run "pipeall.pro", which will perform the 1/f noise removal
   and run the JWST Level 2 pipeline on the cleaned data, creating
   data cubes in the "IFUalign" coordinate system
3. Combine multiple dithers with "postproc.pro" in IDL.
4. "get_spectra.py" depends on "get_ephemerides.py" and can be used to extract spectra,
   divide by a stellar spectrum, and calculate coordinates using information from a JPL Horizons
   query.
